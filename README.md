- Title: Cintel-06-Custom


  For this project I used a basic dataset (penguins) and applied interactive analytics to it! I tested my beginner skills by exploring different dashboards and adding different data tables, grids, maps, and graphs! I also explored using emoji's and icons within the code to help the project standout amongst others! My goal was to keep this project simple, clean, and easy to read for someone who's new to the Shiny platform.
